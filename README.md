## A visualitation tool for exploring Meetup.com groups and their evolution through time

Meeup.com has over 191,000 groups in more than 180 countries around the world. Groups that are created in the virtual world, but meet in the physical world are differen type of human clusterinf and definitely an interesting phenomena to be studied. Groups behave differently throughout time and place. Some of them evolve rapidly while others vanis in short periods of time. Our visualization helps exploring the general behaviour of group evolution over time and provides end-users with answers about dynamics in attendance and events, and patterns across catogories and groups.
